How to Make K12 Schools Safer and Avoid School Shootings

School shootings are a tragic and all too common occurrence in the United States. It's estimated that there have been over 200 school shootings since 2013, with the most recent and deadliest being the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. While no single solution can prevent all school shootings, there are steps that can be taken to make K12 schools safer and help avoid future tragedies.


In this blog post, we will take a look at the problem of school shootings, some of the contributing factors, and strategies that can be implemented to make schools safer. We hope that by increasing understanding and awareness of this issue, we can help make our schools safe havens for learning rather than places of fear.

Understanding the Problem of School Shootings.

A school shooting is an incident of violence that occurs on school property with the intent to cause harm or death. In most cases, the perpetrator is a student or former student of the school.

School shootings are a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. The first recorded instance occurred in 1764, when four Lenape Indian tribe members shot and killed schoolmaster John Fraser during the Paxton Boys' massacre in Pennsylvania. However, it wasn't until the late 20th century that school shootings became more prevalent.

The Columbine High School massacre is often cited as the first modern school shooting. On April 20, 1999, two students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, opened fire at their high school in Littleton, Colorado, killing 12 students and one teacher before taking their own lives. The Columbine shooting sparked a national conversation about school safety and gun violence prevention.

In the years since Columbine, there have been many other high-profile school shootings, including Virginia Tech (2007), Sandy Hook Elementary School (2012), Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (2018), and Santa Fe High School (2018).

Statistics of School Shootings.
According to Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, a nonprofit organization that advocates for gun control measures, there have been over 400 mass shootings in the United States since 2013. Of those 400 incidents, 54 have taken place at schools or on college campuses.

Everytown defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot and killed (not including the shooter). This definition excludes gang violence, domestic violence, and other crimes that may involve guns but don't fit the criteria of a mass shooting.

The organization also reports that there have been nearly 300 school shootings since 2013 when you include incidents where no one was killed but shots were fired on campus. When you include these "near misses," the total number of school shootings since 2013 jumps to almost 700.

It's important to note that school shootings make up a tiny fraction of gun violence in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were over 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S. in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. Of those 38,000 deaths, less than 2% were attributed to mass shootings.

However, school shootings tend to receive a disproportionate amount of media coverage and public attention. This is likely due to the fact that they are often carried out by young people and involve innocent children as victims. School shootings also typically occur without warning, which can add to the sense of fear and panic that these incidents generate.

For these reasons, school shootings are considered a unique and pressing problem in the United States. Although they make up a small percentage of gun violence overall, their frequency has increased in recent years, and they have a major impact on the safety and well-being of students, parents, teachers, and administrators.

Factors Contributing to School Shootings.

Mental health issues are often cited as a major factor in school shootings. It is estimated that between 20% and 30% of school shooters have some sort of mental health diagnosis, such as depression, anxiety, or ADHD. In many cases, these individuals have not been properly diagnosed or treated for their condition. untreated mental health conditions can lead to feelings of isolation, frustration, and anger - all of which can contribute to violence.

Societal Factors.
Societal factors also play a role in school shootings. There is a culture of violence in the United States that is perpetuated by the media and entertainment industry. This culture glamorizes guns and violence, and can desensitize people to the consequences of real-world violence. Additionally, America has a history of racism and discrimination that can lead to feelings of alienation and resentment among certain groups of people. When combined with easy access to firearms, these factors can create a perfect storm for a school shooting to occur.

School Culture.
The culture within a school can also contribute to shootings. Bullying is endemic in many schools, and can make students feel isolated, powerless, and humiliated. A culture of fear or intimidation can also make it difficult for students to report concerns about classmates who may be planning a shooting - meaning that potential threats are not identified and dealt with until it's too late.

Strategies to Make K12 Schools Safer.

There are a number of proactive security measures that can be implemented in K12 schools in order to make them safer and reduce the risk of school shootings. These measures include:

- Conducting threat assessments: This involves identifying potential threats and assessing the risks they pose. Threat assessments can be conducted by school administrators, law enforcement, and mental health professionals.

- Developing emergency response plans: In the event of a school shooting, it is crucial that everyone knows what to do and where to go. Emergency response plans should be developed and regularly practiced by all staff members.

- Training staff and students in active shooter situations: Staff members and students should be trained on how to respond in an active shooter situation. This training should include information on how to identify potential threats, what to do if they are confronted by an active shooter, and how to work with law enforcement during an incident.

- Enhancing security measures: There are a number of security measures that can be put in place to make schools safer, such as metal detectors, security cameras, and armed guards.

Establishing Education Programs.
In addition to proactive security measures, it is also important to establish educational programs aimed at prevention. These programs can address a variety of topics, including bullying prevention, conflict resolution, anger management, and gun safety. It is important that these programs are evidence-based and well-implemented in order to be effective.

Establishing Safer School Environments.
One of the best ways to prevent school shootings is to create safe and supportive school environments where all students feel welcome and accepted. This can be done through positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS), which focus on establishing clear rules and expectations for student behavior, providing consistent consequences for rule violations, and promoting positive relationships between students and adults in the school community.

Conclusion

In conclusion, it is evident that school shootings are a complex problem with no easy solutions. However, there are strategies that can be implemented to make K12 schools safer and help prevent future school shootings. By proactively implementing security measures, establishing education programs, and creating safer school environments, we can work towards making our schools safe for all students.
